# SunFlexPosGrapher
Pairan Pesos Sun Flex Tracker Position Graph Generator

## Motivation ##
To Visualize online the position of several trackers from both an Azimutal and Elevation perspective

## Design ##
The design will be based on the [D3 Library](http://d3js.org/) for visualization. The [API-Reference](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/API-Reference), [examples](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock) and Tutorials will be the starting and feature adding resources we use to construct this Generator.

The graph is to be a "double graph" to visualize at the same time Azimut and Elevation using a similar color scheme corresponding to the same tracker. Perhaps a third Polar/solar Diagram style graph may be presented to have a quick overview of any specific tracker that seems to be not operating normally.

There will be a legend on the side to be able to correlate the colours to a specifc tracker.

### Missing Data ###
Using the [Line with Missing Data](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/0533f44f2cfabecc5e3a) example we should be able to make coherent visualizations.

### Multi-Line Plotting ###
Using the [Multi-Series Line Chart](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3884955) example as a starting point, we can start to parse and plot the data.

### Multi-line Interaction ###
Using the [Multi-Line Voronoi](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/8033015) example, the graph shall be interactive be able to highlight a specific tracker amoung multiple which will be plotted.

The [Cross-linked Mouseover](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3087986) example shall be used for reference to be able to highlight lines on multiple graphs and also the legend at the same time.

The [X-Value Mouseover](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3902569) example may be of use to add some additional information related to the tracker action such as moving, stopped, stuck,etc...

## Testing ##
Testing can be done 
  - locally with Mozilla FireFox
    + loading local files are permissive in this environment. 
  - Online with [Tributary](http://tributary.io/)
    + Suggested by [StackOverflow Question/Answer on File Loading Problems in Chrome](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17094487/how-do-i-open-a-json-file-using-javascript-d3)
  - Web server based

## Data obtention ##
Data is generated by the Pesos Sun Control Software and on the computer running this software we will need to have some sort of File transfer pushing service to upload the data to our web server

Our data is semicolon seperated information which can be parsed following the [d3.csv wiki page](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/CSV). Other references for parseing may be found [here](http://learnjsdata.com/read_data.html)
